Delaunay triangulation in 3D space, to reconstruct convex hull from spherical dot cloud.
```
3D spherical dot cloud can be generated by laser scanner or stereo camera.
```
## Notes
Please run in release mode due to VTK lib version limitation.

## How to use
Follow cmd window, you can choose to use random dot cloud generator or import your own dot cloud file.
