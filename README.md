# DelaunayTriangulation
Delaunay triangulation in 3D space, to reconstruct convex hull from spherical dot cloud.<br />
* 3D spherical dot cloud based on real environment layout can be generated by laser scanner or stereo camera.
* Triangulation helps reveal the geometry structure of the dot cloud and is the most important step towards reconstruction.
## Getting Started
1. Change solution configuration to release mode(VTK lib in this project only support release mode).<br />
2. Build to restore VTK package from nuget.org, compile and run.<br />
3. From command window, you can choose to use random dot cloud generator or import your own dot cloud file.
    1. For dot cloud file format, you can refer to [sample.txt](Resource/sample.txt): "# x y z Red Green Blue"
    2. Random dot cloud generator will also save [a file](Resource/random_out.txt) when executing.
4. Sample output:<br />

![Partial Sphere](https://github.com/xialinbo/DelaunayTriangulation/blob/master/SampleResult/PartialSphereResult.jpg "Partial Sphere")

## How it works
Will explain later with image

## To Do
* ~~Handle holes left due to removing auxiliary triangles~~
