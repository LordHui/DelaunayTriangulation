# DelaunayTriangulation
Delaunay triangulation in 3D space, to reconstruct convex hull from spherical dot cloud.<br />
* 3D spherical dot cloud representing real environment can be generated by laser scanner or stereo camera.
* Triangulation helps reveal the geometry structure of the dot cloud and is the most important step towards reconstruction.
## Getting Started
1. Change solution configuration to release mode(VTK lib in this project only support release mode).<br />
2. Build to restore VTK package from nuget.org, compile and run.<br />
3. From command window, you can choose to use random dot cloud generator or import your own dot cloud file (format refer to sample file).
```
Random dot cloud generator will also save a dot cloud file to Resource folder when executing.
```
4. Sample output:<br>

## How it works
Will explain later with image

## To Do
* Handle holes left after removed extra triangle
